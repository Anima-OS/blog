I'm Mark Bauermeister. The purveyor of this site, "father" of Anima OS and Anglo-Italian software engineer extraordinaire.

Anima has been nothing short of a labour of love for me since I first started working on it, back on a hot Summer day in 2013.

Since then it has gone through several iterations and is now at a point where I feel 
it's pertinent to share its development with the outside world.

For the time being (that is, until this blog is being superseded by a full blown webpage) this blog will therefore serve as a hub for all Anima OS related news.
